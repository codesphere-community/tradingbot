# Trading Bot in Python

## Getting started

1. Create an [Alpaca](https://alpaca.markets/) account (you'll need the secret and public keys to access their API).
2. Update the variables `SEC_KEY` and `PUB_KEY` in `trader.py` with your Alpaca secret and public keys correspondingly.
3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pipenv install
```
4. Activate the environment:
```bash
pipenv shell
```
5. Start the bot:
```bash
python trader.py
```
